Understanding LangWatch concepts can be made easier with two practical examples: an AI travel assistant and a tool for generating blog posts. Let's dive into how each core concept of LangWatch applies to these examples.

Imagine you've created an AI travel assistant that helps users plan their trips by conversing with them to suggest destinations, find the best prices for flights, and assist with bookings. On the other hand, you also have a platform that assists users in generating, and refining blog posts, including SEO optimization.

### Traces

A **trace** in the travel assistant's framework is each distinct message. For example, when a user asks for the best prices to a destination, the trace would include the LLM suggestions, retrieval of options on API, and LLM generation of results. In the blog post tool, a trace could be the for example each time the user clicks to generate a new catchy headline option, clicks to generate the drafting of the body, or to apply the SEO best practices on top. Each trace is a separate task or query handled by the AI.

### Spans

Within each trace, **spans** represent the individual steps taken to achieve the outcome. In the travel bot scenario, a span could be the AI's call to suggest potential destinations, another span for querying the airline price API, and a final span for formatting the response to present to the user. For the blog post tool, one span might be the initial text generation, followed by a subsequent span for LLM to self-critiquing the content, and another span for the third LLM call refining the text based on the critique.

### Threads

A **thread** in the context of the AI travel assistant represents a complete conversation with a user, the group of all spans. It's the entire chat that groups all back-and-forth messages as the user inquires about different aspects of their travel plan. For the blog post tool, a thread could be for example the creation process of a new blog post, encapsulating all interactions that contribute to its completionâ€”from headline generation to the final SEO adjustments.

### User ID

The **user id** identifies the ID of the final user of the product. In the context of both the AI travel assistant and the tool for generating blog posts, it's the ID that identifies the person using the app, usually their user account ID, this allows LangWatch to track how end users are using the product.

### Customer ID

The **customer id** is used when you provide a platform for your customers to build LLM apps for their end users. For example, it would be if your are building a platform that allow _others_ to build AI assistants for _their_ users. Having the **customer id** allows LangWatch to group all metrics and messages per customer, which allows you to access LangWatch data through our APIs to build a custom analytics dashboard for your customers, so they can see how their own LLM assistants are behaving.

### Labels

You can use **labels** to organize and compare the traces sent to LangWatch for any comparison you want to do. You can for example apply different labels for different actions, for example a label `blogpost_title` for generating the blog post title and another `blogpost_keywords`, for generating keywords. You can use it for versioning as well, for example label the first implementation
version as `v1.0.0`, then do a prompt engineering to improve the AI travel planner itenerary builder, and label it as `v1.0.1`. This way you can easily focus on each different functionality or compare versions on LangWatch dashboard.

### LLM Checks

**LLM Checks** are the automated evaluations that occur during or after the AI's operations. For the travel assistant, an LLM Check might analyze the outputs to ensure there's no hallucinated information about flight prices or destinations. It could also verify the AI stays on topic during the travel planning process. In the blog post generation tool, LLM Checks would be crucial for ensuring that the generated content doesn't contain sensitive or prohibited topics, adhering to content guidelines and format requirements.

In both examples, these concepts serve as the backbone of LangWatch's functionality. They allow for detailed monitoring and analysis of how the AI operates, ensuring that every interaction, whether it be a single request for travel advice or a step in crafting a blog post, is recorded, analyzed, and optimized for future interactions. By applying these concepts to your AI applications, you can leverage LangWatch to provide a seamless and compliant user experience.
