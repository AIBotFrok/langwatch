# OpenAI Python Integration

To integrate LangWatch with OpenAI's GPT models using Python, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

- Obtain your `LANGWATCH_API_KEY` from the LangWatch dashboard.

import { OpenAIPython } from "./OpenAIPython"

<OpenAIPython />

After following the above guide, your interactions with LLMs should now
be captured by LangWatch. Once integrated, you can visit your LangWatch
dashboard to view and analyze the traces collected from your
applications.
